---------------------------------------------

This is an enhanced sample project for the "RPG Developer Bakin" battle plug-in featuring a comprehensive Pokemon-style battle system with dual-types, priority attacks, capture mechanics, IV/EV systems, and more.

A plug-in written in C# is stored in the 'battlescript' folder directly under the project folder.

--- ENHANCED FEATURES OVERVIEW ---

--- DETAILED SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION ---

üå§Ô∏è POKEMON-STYLE WEATHER SYSTEM
Location: Lines 156-233 in BattleSequenceManager.cs

WEATHER VARIABLE INTEGRATION:
‚úÖ Reads from in-game variable "Weather" for current weather state
‚úÖ Formula integration via "weather" variable in damage calculations
‚úÖ Real-time weather effects during battle

WEATHER TYPES & EFFECTS:
‚Ä¢ Weather = 0 (Clear): No weather effects (1.0x multiplier)
‚Ä¢ Weather = 1 (Rain): Water moves boosted 1.5x, Fire moves reduced 0.5x
‚Ä¢ Weather = 2 (Sun): Fire moves boosted 1.5x, Water moves reduced 0.5x  
‚Ä¢ Weather = 3 (Sandstorm): Rock/Ground/Steel moves boosted 1.2x
‚Ä¢ Weather = 4 (Hail): Ice moves boosted 1.2x

USAGE IN FORMULAS:
Example damage formula with weather: "max(1, floor(base_damage * edef * weather))"
The "weather" variable automatically applies appropriate multipliers based on move type.

üî• COMPLETE POKEMON TYPE EFFECTIVENESS SYSTEM + STAB
Location: Lines 6395-6800 in BattleSequenceManager.cs

FULL POKEMON GEN 6+ TYPE CHART IMPLEMENTATION:
‚úÖ All 18 Official Pokemon Types Supported
‚úÖ Complete Type Effectiveness Chart (324 matchups)
‚úÖ Official Pokemon Damage Formula Integration
‚úÖ STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) System
‚úÖ Formula Variable Integration (edef)

HOW IT WORKS:
1. Add type tags to monster management tags: "#fire", "#water", "#grass #poison"
2. Add type tags to skill tags: "#fire #highpriority", "#water #ice"
3. System automatically calculates effectiveness using complete Pokemon type chart
4. Dual-type attacks average their effectiveness (prevents overpowered combinations)
5. Dual-type defenders multiply effectiveness (traditional Pokemon rules)
6. STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus): 1.5x damage when attacker's type matches attack type

COMPLETE TYPE CHART (Gen 6+ Accurate):
- 0.0x (No Effect): Electric ‚Üí Ground, Fighting ‚Üí Ghost, Normal ‚Üí Ghost, etc.
- 0.5x (Not Very Effective): Fire ‚Üí Water, Water ‚Üí Grass, Psychic ‚Üí Psychic, etc.
- 1.0x (Normal Damage): Neutral matchups
- 2.0x (Super Effective): Fire ‚Üí Grass, Water ‚Üí Fire, Fighting ‚Üí Normal, etc.

OFFICIAL POKEMON DAMAGE FORMULA:
Uses authentic Pokemon damage calculation with proper rounding:
```
floor(floor(floor(floor(2 * level / 5 + 2) * power * attack / defense) / 50) + 2) * edef)
```

FORMULA INTEGRATION:
- 'edef' variable: Returns complete type effectiveness multiplier
- Works in skill damage formulas alongside other variables (spatk, spdef, etc.)
- Includes STAB calculation automatically
- Matches official Pokemon damage calculator results

STAB EXAMPLES:
- Psychic-type Mew using Psychic skill (#psychic): 1.5x STAB bonus
- Fire/Flying dual-type using Fire Blast (#fire): 1.5x STAB bonus  
- Water-type using Fire skill (#fire): No STAB bonus (1.0x)

CALCULATION ORDER:
1. Base type effectiveness calculated (e.g., Psychic vs Psychic = 0.5x)
2. STAB bonus applied if types match (e.g., 0.5x √ó 1.5x = 0.75x)
3. Final multiplier returned via 'edef' variable
4. Applied in damage formula for accurate Pokemon-style damage

ALL 18 POKEMON TYPES SUPPORTED:
normal, fire, water, electric, grass, ice, fighting, poison, ground, flying, 
psychic, bug, rock, ghost, dragon, dark, steel, fairy
(Note: "wind" supported as alias for "flying")

TYPE EFFECTIVENESS EXAMPLES:
- Fire ‚Üí Grass/Ice/Bug/Steel = 2.0x (Super Effective)
- Water ‚Üí Fire/Ground/Rock = 2.0x (Super Effective)
- Electric ‚Üí Water/Flying = 2.0x (Super Effective)
- Electric ‚Üí Ground = 0.0x (No Effect)
- Psychic ‚Üí Fighting/Poison = 2.0x (Super Effective)
- Psychic ‚Üí Dark = 0.0x (No Effect)

CUSTOMIZATION:
- Add new types: Modify commonTypes array lines 6575-6577
- Edit type chart: Modify GetTypeEffectiveness() function lines 6645-6800
- Adjust STAB multiplier: Modify STAB_MULTIPLIER constant line 6509 (default: 1.5f)
- Adjust calculation method: Modify CalculateDualTypeEffectiveness() lines 6395-6499

INTEGRATION POINTS:
- Formula variable: 'edef' in damage formulas
- Weapon damage: Line 2332 CalcAttackWithWeaponDamage()
- Skill damage: Lines 3605, 3733, 3752 in skill effect calculations
- Direct formula access: parseBattleNum() function line 2707

OFFICIAL POKEMON FORMULA IMPLEMENTATION:
Based on Smogon damage calculator source code (https://github.com/smogon/damage-calc)
- Authentic multi-step floor() rounding behavior
- Proper level/power/stat calculation order  
- Verified against official Pokemon damage calculator
- Produces identical results to competitive Pokemon tools

EXAMPLE CALCULATION (Level 1 Mew vs Level 1 Mew):
1. floor(2 * 1 / 5 + 2) = floor(2.4) = 2
2. floor(2 * 90 * 7 / 7) = floor(180) = 180  
3. floor(180 / 50) = floor(3.6) = 3
4. 3 + 2 = 5 (base damage)
5. floor(5 * 0.75) = floor(3.75) = 3 (final damage)

DEBUGGING & VERIFICATION:
- "TYPE CALC" logs: Complete calculation breakdown
- "SIMPLE TYPE" logs: Formula context calculations  
- "EDEF FORMULA" logs: Formula variable integration
- "EDEF DEBUG" logs: Function call verification

ENABLE/DISABLE LOGGING:
- Comment out GameMain.PushLog() calls to reduce output
- Search for "Debug" to find all debug logging statements

--- ORIGINAL CTB FEATURES (Preserved) ---

What this sample battle plug-in does is roughly the following three things:
- Based on the status of the cast members' "agility," a value (count) is added over time, and the cast member who has reached the specified value can choose their action.
- Stores the accumulated counts in the variable "turnCount", which can be referenced from the Layout Tool.
- New special formats available in the Layout Tool: "battleext" for displaying the order of actions, and "CtbSelected[]", a special coordinate specification tag for indicating the opponent of an attack.

--- LAYOUTS ---
The layout for displaying the order of actions during battle is created in the Layout Tool > Battle Statuses.
Two layouts are currently available.

Type-A
This layout shows the order of actions by the sequence of cast icons.
Text panels that display the special format "battleext" are lined up on the battle status screen.
The "battleext" checks the count of each cast and displays an icon image of the cast (or a graphic for movement if not specified) according to the order of their actions.
To indicate when the enemy selected as the attack target is scheduled to act, rendering containers with the special coordinate specification tag CtbSelected[] are used.

Type-B„ÄÄ
This layout shows the count of each cast in the form of gauges.
Added slider rendering panels (part name "Count Gauge") to the battle status screen to display gauges based on the value of "turnCount".
The layout also includes hidden parts that display an enemy status.  Please refer to it.

- Other battle-related screen layouts are adjusted to match the display of each battle status.
- After starting the sample project, you can talk to the statue at the rear of the map to switch the battle layout to be used.

--- CAMERAS ---
Two types of preset data were added to the Battle Camera.
Battle Camera E: Side-view type for either layout Type-A or B
Battle Camera F: Back view type suitable for layout Type-B
After selecting the battle camera in the Camera Tool, you can select it from the Load from Presets button. The default battle camera for the project is Battle Camera E.

--- How to Apply This Project's Battle Script to Your Own Project
*Some of the image data uses assets that are included when the amount of assets is set to "Normal" when creating a new project.
If you do not find the images you need in your project after performing the following operations, please use multiple launches of Bakin and copy the resources from the sample game "Orb Stories" or from a new project created with the asset amount set to "Normal".„ÄÄ

1. Copy the 'battlescript' folder directly under the project you want to reflect.
2. Launch Battle Plug-in Sample, open the Layout Tool, and right-click on the preview screen. Save the layouts to a file.
3. Open the project you want to reflect and right-click in the preview window of the Layout Tool. Load the .lyrbr file you just saved.

ADDITIONAL STEPS FOR ENHANCED FEATURES:
4. Add type management tags to your monsters (e.g., "#fire", "#water #ice")
5. Add type and priority tags to your skills (e.g., "#fire #highpriority")
6. Create status conditions with "#switchclear" tags for switching mechanics
7. Test the dual-type effectiveness with various type combinations
8. Customize the type chart in GetTypeEffectiveness() for your game's balance
